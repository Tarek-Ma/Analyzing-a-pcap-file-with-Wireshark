## Introduction

You work as an analyst at a Security Operation Center (SOC). Someone contacts your team to report a coworker has downloaded a suspicious file after searching for Google Authenticator. The caller provides some information similar to social media posts at:

https://www.linkedin.com/posts/unit42_2025-01-22-wednesday-a-malicious-ad-led-activity-7288213662329192450-ky3V/
https://x.com/Unit42_Intel/status/1882448037030584611
Based on the caller's initial information, you confirm there was an infection.  You retrieve a packet capture (pcap) of the associated traffic.  Reviewing the traffic, you find several indicators matching details from a Github page referenced in the above social media posts.  After confirming an infection happened, you begin writing an incident report.

 ## Investigation

 ### Victim's Details :

**IP address** : `10.1.17.215`

**Mac address** : `00:d0:b7:26:4a:74`

**Host name** : `DESKTOP-L8C5GSJ`

**User name account** : `shutchenson`

---

 We start with an overview of the pcap file. It contains 39,427 packets : IPv4 represents 99.1% of the traffic, TCP 93.2%, TLS 17.2% and we also see some clear HTTP (3.2%) which can be interesting.

</a>

Next we filter HTTP and TLS to check the visited domains. ( filter used : `http or tls.handshake.type==1 and !(ssdp)` )
We know that the client downloaded a file after searching for **' google Authenticator '**
By scrolling the results, we can see 2 suspicious domains (`google-authenticator.burleson-appliance.net` and `authenticatoor.org` ). We checked them with Virustotal and they look malicious.

We assume the client clicked on a URL and was redirected to the malicious website ( The caller reported links from Twitter and Linkedin ).
We also see 2 successful GET requests ( **HTTP 200 OK** ) with files : `264872` and `29842.ps1`.

Let's analyze these 2 files. To export HTTP files with Wireshark we go to -> File -> Export objects -> HTTP.

We calculated the hash of the first file and we analyzed it with Virustotal. The result shows this file is malicious.

Following the HTTP stream, the content is a VBScript that allows remote code execution. Here, the script runs Powershell in hidden mode and downloads another script ( `29842.ps1` ) from the server with IP : `5.252.153.241`

![](https://i.postimg.cc/dtx8xRYz/wireshark6.png)

The second file (`29842.ps1`) is also malicious, it contains obfuscated code encoded in Base64, we decode it with Cyberchef and we get this script : 

![](https://i.postimg.cc/rmGSz774/wireshark8.png)

The script reads the serial number of the **`C-Disk`**, builds a URL with this value, and if true, it tries to download the text content and execute the code with `Invoke-Expression`, the script loops every 5 seconds.

With this information, we can confirm that the C2 server has for primary IP : `5.252.153.241` ( this IP is also marked as malicious by Virustotal ) and the victim IP is : `10.1.17.215`. We can support this confirmation by looking at the **Conversations** with Wireshark : there are > 9,000 packets exchanged between these 2 IPs.

---

Continuing our investigation, we found 1 successful GET request with a script inside ( TCP stream no. 61 ). The script contains 5 functions : **Download-Files**, **Create-Shortcut**, **Invoke-Startup**, **Send-Log**, **ConvertTo-StringData**.

  <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/WzjTvpDQ/wireshark13.png" width="700"/>
</a>

The script has downloaded successfully 4 files and created a startup shortcut as we shown in the screenshot :
`TeamViewer`,
`TeamViewer_Ressource_fr`,
`TV`,
`pas.ps1`.

![](https://i.postimg.cc/3JpZkKck/wireshark11.png)

We obtained the hashes for these files and analyzed them :

`TeamViewer` Not flagged as malicious. It is signed by Teamviewer GmbH, but the signature is revoked (according to Virustotal). In this context, we can say that TeamViewer is installed to keep **persistence** in the victim's machine.

`TeamViewer_Ressource_fr` Not flagged as malicious, same as **TeamViewer**. The signature is also revoked (according to Virustotal).

`TV` Clearly malicious. This file was executed by Powershell ( **parent process: pas.ps1**).

`pas.ps1` Flagged as malicious.


---


We also found 3 GET request that include a **run / process started** message at frames `19292`, `28335` and `33356`.

When we follow the HTTP stream (no.162), the server returned a large Base64 encoded payload, the victim saved and decoded the payload to `C:\ProgramData\jsLeow\skqllz.ps1` . This looks like the second stage payload delivered by the C2.

  <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/5tB4ykcc/wireshark16.png" width="700"/>
</a>

After decoding the Base64 payload and calculated its hash, we found it is malicious. According to Virustotal, the payload contacted 1 IP : `45.125.66.32`. We also see this IP in our pcap : The Conversation view in Wireshark shows > 10,000 packets exchanged with this IP and the victim IP :
